# AI Policy

AI tooling can be used when contributing to the Rust project, but AI-generated contributions are
subject to the same conditions as any other contribution to Rust.

All contributors are responsible for ensuring that their contributions follow Rust's [Code of
Conduct][coc] (which prohibits spam) and that they have the right to make their contribution under
the terms of the project's license:

- Contributions should not be entirely generated by AI as these are unlikely to be useful or
  productive and can waste limited reviewer time. It is crucial that good judgement and discretion
  is used in all contributions and that all contributions are fully understood by their author.
- Contributors using AI tooling are responsible for ensuring that they own the copyright to their
  contribution and can therefore license the contribution according to any given project
  repository's stated licensing policy (for example, by using models trained only on
  appropriately-licensed input or where the output is entirely derivative of the
  appropriately-licensed input).

Contributions generated by AI which do not comply with this policy will be subject to action from
Rust's moderation team (such as removal of the contribution, or suspension/bans from the project,
etc) without notice.
